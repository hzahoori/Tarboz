<h4>Acceptable Use Policy</h4> 
<p>
While the administrators and moderators of this website will attempt to remove or edit any generally objectionable material as quickly as possible, it is impossible to review every message. Therefore you acknowledge that all posts made to this website express the views and opinions of the author and not the administrators, moderators or webmaster (except for messages by these people) and hence will not be held liable. 

You agree not to post any abusive, obscene, vulgar, slanderous, libelous, derogatory, hateful, threatening, sexually-oriented or any other material that may violate any applicable laws. Doing so may lead to you being immediately and permanently banned (and your service provider being informed). 

You agree not to post any messages advertising or promoting any product, publication, event, service or other venture, regardless of whether or not it is for profit (second hand items may be advertised in the appropriate forum). The forums and messaging facilities are strictly non-commercial. If you wish to advertise at Forensic Focus please see the relevant advertising section in the main menu for details. Furthermore, please note that promoting a petition or survey is not deemed acceptable use of the forums and/or messaging facilities. 

It is the policy of this site to promote open discussion amongst practitioners of all experience levels. To facilitate that discussion new members are encouraged to use this site's and other online search facilities before posting a question or request for assistance. However, please note that criticising another member for not having searched elsewhere before posting constitutes unacceptable use of this site. 

It is impossible for us to confirm the validity of posts on this forum. Please remember that we do not actively monitor the posted messages and are not responsible for their content. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information presented. The messages express the views of the author, not necessarily the views of this forum. Anyone who feels that a posted message is objectionable is encouraged to notify an administrator of this forum immediately. We have the right to remove objectionable content, within a reasonable time frame, if we determine that removal is necessary. Any removal will be completed as soon as possible. We also retain the right to edit, move or delete any posted message and suspend, delete or deny any account or account registration request without giving any reason. 

Account owners are expressly prohibited from using another account if an existing account has been closed or suspended or previous registration request denied. Any such action will result in a permanent ban with no further correspondence being entered into. 

Webinar announcements, site updates, surveys and other news items may be sent to you via email. You may unsubscribe from these emails at any time.

<h4>Privacy Policy </h4>

<p>The privacy of our visitors is important to us.</p> 

<p>At Forensic Focus, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit Forensic Focus, and how we safeguard your information. 

Log Files</p> 

<p>As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. 

Cookies and Web Beacons </p>

<p>We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums. 

We also use third party advertisements on Forensic Focus to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). 

DoubleClick DART cookies  </p>

<p>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx 

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts. 

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added. 

As a user you agree to any information you have entered being stored in a database or file. The webmaster, administrator and moderators cannot be held responsible for any hacking attempt that may lead to the safety of the data being compromised.

By clicking Register below you agree to be bound by these conditions.</p>
